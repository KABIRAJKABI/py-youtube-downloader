## [Author Kabiraj😃](https://github.com/KABIRAJKABI)
im a beginner to this kind of things so help me to imporve myself if you find anything wrong 

## LIBRARIES USED:
 1.▶[pytube==11.0.2](https://github.com/pytube/pytube)
 2.🎥[FFMPEG](https://github.com/GyanD/codexffmpeg/releases)
 
## Requirements:
make sure you have python 3.9 installed
Winrar to unrar the ffmpeg.rar file

## lib Requriements.txt(for those who dont use :
    pip install pytube>=11.0.1
    pip install progressbar
## Instructions:
note:this code now works on windows only suports will extedned soon 
1.unrar ffmpeg.exe  file from into the same folder becasue it is used to merge audio and video in some cases
2.run the script from terminal/shell/cmd using pyhton pydl.py

## NOTE:for VSCode peoples:
   If you run the code using the in-built option Run(run-the-pythonfile) or run in terminal
   you will face error

## FIX for VScode:
   Go to VSCode Settings>extensions>python
   on that check the checkbox: python>Terminal:Execute In File Dir 

   or

   Go to VSCode Settings>extensions>python
   select the Edit in the settings.json
   search for the line
 ## code:
       "python.terminal.executeInFileDir": false

   It will be in false because the check box is not checked
   change "false" to "true"
   like below
## code:
      "python.terminal.executeInFileDir": true

# Thank You🐍💗
